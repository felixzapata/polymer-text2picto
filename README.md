# polymer-text2picto
Polymer component to use the Text2Picto service to translate simple texts to pictograms.

The idea of this component is based on the project [Able to Include](http://able-to-include.com/), who is under the framework of Competitiveness and Innovation Framework programme (CIP PSP). A programme co-funded by the European Union.

The objective of Able to Include is to ease the integration of people with intellectual disabilities.

This component is a wrapper of the [Text2Picto tool](http://able-to-include.com/accessible-services/services/text-to-pictograms/), developed by the University of Leuven (Belgium).

They use two picture languages:

* Beta
* Sclera
